This project has been made over the RestEasy framework, a RESTFul implementation for JBoss application
servers.

To solve the scalability requiriments APIs were designed to support Models and Attributes registers. The
user can add Models and theirs attributes freely and use them later to insert new items based in that
structure.

Databases were not applied to simplify the solution. Instead memory repositories has been used to
store the objects.

To test the solution use the CURL tool. Same examples are located at the path below:
